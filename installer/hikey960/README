These instructions will help you in flashing the prebuilt bootloader
images and AOSP images (built from sources) on hikey960.

Detailed instructions on Board setup and recovery can be found here
https://github.com/96boards-hikey/tools-images-hikey960/blob/master/README.md

Boot switch behind the board, just beneath the mezzanine connector
slot is used to boot into recovery and bootloader modes.
* To boot into fastboot mode everytime set switch 1 & 3 to ON state
  and switch 2 to OFF state.
* To boot into fastboot mode at every alternate rebooot set switch 1
  to ON and switch 2 & 3 to OFF state.
* To boot into recovery mode set switch 1 & 2 to ON state and switch 3
  to OFF state

Run the flash-all.sh script to update boot files using fastboot.
It assumes that you have already build hikey960 AOSP images locally.
$ ./flash-all.sh
