These instructions will help you in flashing the prebuilt bootloader
images and AOSP images (built from sources) on hikey960.

Detailed instructions on Board setup and recovery can be found here
https://github.com/96boards-hikey/tools-images-hikey960/blob/master/README.md

There are two versions of HiKey960: v1 and v2.
* v1 is using Jumper (J2001)
* v2 is using DIP switch (SW2201).
Both are located at the bottom side of the board.

Jumper Pin 1-2 = DIP switch 1
Jumper Pin 3-4 = DIP switch 2
JUmper Pin 5-6 = DIP switch 3

* To boot into fastboot mode everytime set switch 1 & 3 to ON state
  and switch 2 to OFF state.
* To boot into fastboot mode at every alternate rebooot set switch 1
  to ON and switch 2 & 3 to OFF state.
* To boot into recovery mode set switch 1 & 2 to ON state and switch 3
  to OFF state

Run the flash-all.sh script to update boot files using fastboot.
It assumes that you have already build hikey960 AOSP images locally.
$ ./flash-all.sh
